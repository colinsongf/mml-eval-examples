=================

Some examples on how to use MyMediaLite for offline experiments.
Initially created for my Berlin Buzzwords 2013 talk:
http://berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/recommender-systems-experiments-mymedialite

MyMediaLite runs on Mono/.NET, so make sure to have at least Mono 2.10
installed on your system.

Run "make download-movielens" before trying any of the other make targets.
